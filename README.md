# Project 02 - Plan your trip with Kayak

## Objectives

* **Obtain the GPS coordonates of the cities listed in *instructions.md***

We have been provided with a list of 35 cities for which we have been requested to provided the GPS coordinates.

* **Determine the cities where the temperature will be the nicest within the next 7 days**

We decided to use the average temperature of the city within the next 7 days. As the dataset has been realized in march 2022, weather in France is quite ok and no many rain. So the daily.pop will be useless in our case




## Prerequisites

* You must suscribe to [Open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/appid) in order to get a free apikey.
